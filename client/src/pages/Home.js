          The 'Net Zero Carbon' Course is a ground breaking effort that aims to
          equip participants with the information, skills, and practical tools
          they need to face one of our generation's most pressing challenges:
          constructing a sustainable, net-zero carbon future. The flexible
          program options will allow participants to select the educational
          opportunity that best meets their needs and timetable. This training
          is suited for both participants looking for a more in-depth experience
          and working professionals in top to middle management looking for a
          quick overview.
